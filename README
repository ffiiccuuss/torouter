Your DreamPlug has arrived in a disabled state - you will need to hack it:

0) re-flash from inside the OS it shipped with:
  https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/DebianDreamPlug#Step9:IfyoucannotsuccessfullystarttheUSBdevices

1) Create a bootable USB disk, attach the JTAG, boot/re-flash, ..., anonymity!

2) A new thing that is currently undocumented

To create a Torouter from this repository you'll want to clone it:

  git clone git://git.torproject.org/torouter.git

Please see the freedom-maker/README if you wish to create a bootable USB disk.
You will want a USB disk and the DreamPlug JTAG for reflashing, reinstalling,
and development related activities.
