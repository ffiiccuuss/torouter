- re-factor the script(s) to allow building for at least Sheeva and Dream
- fold in use of vmdebootstrap to build x86 image(s)
- there are a few things we really do want to defer to first boot, or at least
  make it trivial to fix up per-system
	- ssh host keys
	- root password
- decide what we're going to do about the provided u-boot .. use or replace?
- decide which kernel we actually want to run and incorporate into the build
- work out recommended process for getting from freedom-maker outputs to bits
  installed and running on each target type
	- DreamPlug:	sh /boot/copy2dream.sh
- add Sheeva as a build target
- add x86 virtualized as a build target (use vmdebootstrap?)
