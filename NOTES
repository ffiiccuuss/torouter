    torouter_takeover.sh
        add torproject keys (prompt?)
        setup sources.list
        apt-get update
        install dependancies like: (some should be torouter-prep deps?)
            tor
            torouterui
            crontab
        run torouter_preboot.sh
        new ssh keys?
    torouter_preboot.sh
        check that dependancies are installed (tor, torouterui, etc) or fail
        copy/install configuration files
        remove/disable unwanted packages
        stop libertas module from loading
        create users and groups
    torouter_copy2internal.sh (TODO)
    torouter_setupuboot.sh (TODO)

torouter-prep contains all the above files

torouter_easy_setup.sh installs torouter-prep, executes torouter-takeover,
then reboots. it should be included in torouter-prep (for signing?)

install.sh script executes withing qemu:
    configures all installed packages
    run torouter_preboot.sh
    install .deb src packages
    kernel re-packing
    (re)set root password
    (re)set user password
    unconfigure sshd (so it will get re-configured on 1st boot)

differences between takeover and .img build process:
- don't need new ssh keys with takeover
- don't need kernel re-pack with takeover
- don't need fstab re-write with takeover
