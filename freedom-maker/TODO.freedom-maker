- [ ] initial boot configuration improvements, as there are a few
  things we really do want to defer to first boot, or at least make it
  trivial to fix up per-system

	- [X] ssh host keys
	- [ ] root password
- [ ] add Sheeva as a build target
- [X] add x86 virtualized as a build target (use vmdebootstrap?)
- [ ] investigate and integrate software components that looks interesting
	- channel-server, the buddycloud channels service for XMPP
	- babeld, loop-free distance-vector routing protocol
	- tahoe-lafs, secure distributed filesystem
- [ ] virtualbox should build with dreamplug configuration

*** stuff to do for first feature release ***

  - [ ] pre-configured user interface
	- [X] DHCP and HTTP servers on eth0 and/or eth1
	- [ ] plinth-based initial config interface

  - [ ] freedom buddy installed
  - [ ] openvpn server setup
  - [ ] the privoxy fork configured as a transparent proxy
  - [ ] plinth configured to at display these config details and to
   control whatever is feasible
