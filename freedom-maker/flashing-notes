  Sort of.  The openocd config for the sheevaplug/guruplug is what I use,
  and is distributed on the dreamplug download page [1].  It does _not_
  have support for the SPI flash.  You can also use the sheevaplug.cfg
  shipped with openocd.  So, I use openocd or tftp to transfer to RAM,
  then use u-boot to write to flash.

  To test images, or to reflash, I load the known-good u-boot into RAM via
  openocd, then I'll either reflash it or load a new testing one from
  there.

  To write a u-boot.kwb test image to flash, here is what I do:

  openocd$ sheevaplug_init
  openocd$ load_image u-boot                 # known good from Marvell
  openocd$ load_image u-boot.kwb 0x00800000  # monster I created
  openocd$ resume 0x00600000                 # run the known good

  then, in u-boot

  u-boot$ sf probe 0
  u-boot$ sf erase 0x0 0x100000
  u-boot$ sf write 0x00800000 0x0 0x100000

  If time allows, I'd like to add SPI flash support to OpenOCD.
  Unfortunately, time is short and the above process works.
