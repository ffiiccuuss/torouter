system config files should live here in ./config

    torouter-takeover
        add torproject keys (prompt?)
        setup sources.list
        apt-get update
        install dependancies like tor and torouterui
        run torouter_preboot.sh
    torouter-preboot
        check that dependancies are installed (tor, torouterui, etc) or fail
        copy/install all configuration files
        install 
        create users and groups
        remove/disable unwanted packages
        setup firstboot
    torouter-firstboot (just generates ssh keys; could be done elsewhere?)
    torouter-copy2internal (TODO)
    torouter-setupuboot (TODO)

torouter-prep contains all the above files

torouter_easy_setup.sh installs torouter-prep, executes torouter-takeover,
then reboots. it should be included in torouter-prep (for signing?)

install.sh script executes withing qemu:
    configures all installed packages
    run torouter_preboot.sh
    install .deb src packages
    kernel re-packing
    (re)set root password
    (re)set user password
    unconfigure sshd (so it will get re-configured on 1st boot)

differences between takeover and .img build process:
- don't need new ssh keys with takeover
- don't need kernel re-pack with takeover
- don't need fstab re-write with takeover
