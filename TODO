- fix signing key for torrouter.torproject.org (should have a keyring .deb)
- re-enable source builds in install.sh
- fix/clarify current broken DNS situation
- .onion addresses don't "just work" yet
- clarify u-boot and bootloader configuration in docs
- easy_setup is out of date
- need a custom kernel build and package system for grsec etc patches
- include updated u-boot image and env config in /boot
- include "man" and documentation files
- install/configure power management tools (to minimize consumption)

might not fix:
- kernel flashing code in install.sh is kernel-version specific
